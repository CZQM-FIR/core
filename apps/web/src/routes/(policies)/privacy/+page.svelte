    <h1>CZQM / QX Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      When you use CZQM / QX Moncton / Gander services such as but not limited to czqm.ca, and the
      CZQM Discord, there is information sent to us and stored to allow us to provide services to
      you. Please familiarize yourself with our full privacy policy below.
    </p>
    <h2>Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Information is collected from a variety of sources, many of which do not come directly from
      the CZQM website.
    </p>
    <h3>VATSIM</h3>
    <p>
      When you register an account with VATSIM, a number of pieces of information, including but not
      limited to full name and email address, are collected and associated with your account. When
      you log into the CZQM website with your VATSIM, this information is then accessed and stored
      by CZQM. This information is accessed and updated every time you log in to the CZQM website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information regarding the connection sessions of our members is also stored. This information
      is used to monitor compliance with our other policies and to analyze statistics regarding our
      members activity on the VATSIM network. Whenever a member of the CZQM FIR connects to the
      VATSIM network as a controller, the following information is stored:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connection Start Time</li>
      <li>Connection Duration</li>
      <li>Callsign</li>
      <li>Frequency</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>VATCAN</h3>
    <p>
      When you transfer to the CZQM FIR through <a href="https://vatcan.ca">VATCAN.ca</a>, your
      name, email address, and other VATSIM account information are collected and stored by CZQM.
      This information is accessed and updated daily.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      To allow the function of the core CZQM web services, we utilize your information across
      several of our services. We will never share your data unless required by law. The information
      we collect is maintained with confidentiality to the extent possible.
    </p>
    <p>The following account information may be shared publicly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>VATSIM Certificate ID (CID)</li>
      <li>Your full name</li>
      <li>Your vatsim rating and account status</li>
      <li>VATCAN Facility Association</li>
      <li>Your VATSIM controlling sessions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Cookies">browser cookie</a
      > entitled "session" will be stored in your browser when signed in to czqm.ca and other CZQM subdomains.
      This cookie is required for basic web functionality and may not be opted out of. This cookie will
      never be used to track users across non-CZQM operated websites. 3rd Party Cookies will not be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may choose to disable cookie usage via your browser, but doing so will prevent access and
      use across restricted areas of the website and severely degrade your experience and place you
      at risk of violating other CZQM policies by not being able to fulfil member requirements.
    </p>
    <h2>Your Rights Regarding Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      As a sub-division of VATCAN and VATSIM, you are entitled to the same rights as provided to you
      by the VATSIM Network and as required by PIPEDA and GDPR (EU Citizens Only).
    </p>
    <h3>Request for Access</h3>

      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data requests will be honoured and delivered within one month. In the event CZQM cannot meet

      extension from the time of your initial request.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      You have the right to request we restrict the processing of your data in the event of a
      dispute, this may restrict your ability to connect to the network and your status as an active
      CZQM controller (if applicable).
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the right to object to our legitimate interests. While your objection is being
      considered, processing of your data may be frozen, and this may restrict your ability to

    </p>
    <h3>Right to be Forgotten</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request the erasure of your data from our systems. This will result in
      the termination of your controller or visitor status with CZQM (if applicable). Should you
      continue to access the CZQM website, your data will be re-collected from VATSIM and VATCAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you wish for your data to be removed from VATCAN or VATSIM, please contact them
      directly as outlined in their privacy policies.
